# Hannah's Recipe Finder

#### Description:
Hannah's recipe machine is an program with a GUI that allows the user to manage and access saved recipes. It allows you to add, edit, and delete saved recipes through its user interface. It also incorporates a web scraper for Bon Appetit, Food52, and Sally's Baking addiction that allows users to search, view, and save selected recipes to the user's computer. This allows the user to easily save recipes in a consistent format, rather than have a bunch of websites bookmarked. Recipe websites are annoying, and this removes all of the superfluous text and storytelling, and creates a streamlines way to save recipes. 

My wife is a pastry chef, and the program comes with her collection of recipes. I recommend the browned butter chocolate chip cookies, you'll never look at a regular chocolate chip cookie the same way after eating them.
