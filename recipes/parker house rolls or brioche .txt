Parker House rolls or brioche 

2 t active dry yeast 
.25 very warm water
? c milk, room temp 
1 T sugar
1 .5 t salt 
2 oz butter (half a stick) 
2 yolks 
2 .75 c Ap flour 

Bloom yeast in warm water for 5-8 min in a mixing bowl. Mix together flour, sugar and salt and set aside. Measure milk, add in yolks and mix until combined. Once yeast has bloomed, add in milk/yolk mixture and dry ingredients and using a dough hook mix on low until a shaggy dough forms. If its sticking to the bottom, let mix a minute or two and if it doesnt lift, add in a pinch of flour. If its too dry, you can add a splash of water until it gets stickier. Let dough mix for 3 min or until smooth. Add in butter a teaspoon at at time (i just use my hands and grab small chunks) letting each single piece to fully combine before you add the next butter chunk. This takes a while, be patient! Once youve added all the butter, transfer dough ball to a greased bowl and cover with saran (a shower cap is really good for this too) and let proof for an hour. Dough should double in size. After proofed, gently dump dough out on the counter and portion into 10-12 pieces. To shape them roll each piece into a ball. Using one hand gently push the dough in a circle, guiding it with your palm gently. Circle until there is no seam on the bottom of the dough ball. Or youtube it! Place rolls into a greased 9 in pan (shape doesnt matter) cover with saran, and let rise for another hour. Just before baking melt .5 stick of butter and brush the tops, then sprinkle everything bagel seasoning or 2 teaspoons each of dried onion, sesame seeds, salt, black sesame or poppy seeds and 1 teaspoon dried garlic. Bake at 350 for about 25 min or until done.
